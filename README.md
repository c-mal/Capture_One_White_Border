This script uses the system arguments to import the photograph of your choosing. To run, compile into an executable with auto-py-to-exe or similar, then open the image you want framed with the executable. 
Ideally, you can configure your photo editor to automatically open the image with the executable after exporting.

You can modify the color of the frame as well, it is currently set to generate a white frame.
